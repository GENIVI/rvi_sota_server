This page details all currently whitelisted interactions. When creating
stories in JIRA, you must note any interactions between components that will
be required. If they are not already covered by a whitelisted interaction in
this list, you must review them with the project security curator. If the new
interactions are approved, they will be added to this list. Code *will not be
merged* if it contains non-whitelisted interactions.

Whitelisted interactions are organized by boundary:
