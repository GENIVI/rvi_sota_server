All code contributed to this project must be licensed under the https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/[MPL v2 license], a copy of which you can find in this repository. Documentation must be licensed under the https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/[CC BY 4.0 license].

=== Documentation

We don't want to settle for just making sure RVI SOTA is a great piece of software; we want it to be something that people are interesting in using, understanding, and contributing to. To that end, we strive to make these docs as clear, up-to-date, and comprehensive as possible. So if there's anything you're having trouble with, please don't hesitate to engage with us on the https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/automotive-eg-rvi[automotive-eg-rvi] or http://lists.genivi.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/genivi-projects[GENIVI Projects] mailing list. Or if you want to contribute to the documentation directly, you'll find the sources for the documentation site in rvi_sota_server/docs. The docs are written in Asciidoc format (syntax reference http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[here], but if you're familiar with Markdown you'll feel right at home), and rendered using https://jekyllrb.com/[Jekyll] and http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor].
