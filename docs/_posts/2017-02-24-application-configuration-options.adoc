SOTA Server has a number of configuration options that can be set using environment variables. In general, the defaults are sane options for running a local development instance. The link:../doc/deployment-with-dockercompose.html[docker-compose files] also set a number of these environment variables to values which are sane defaults for a Docker-based local setup.
