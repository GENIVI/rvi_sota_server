## <a name="implementation-phases">Implementation Phases</a>

The implementation of the SOTA project is split into seven phases:

   * [FIRST](#requirements-first) Initial version of SOTA system
   * [COMP](#requirements-comp) Adds component management, associating one ore more components with a specific VIN
   * [INST](#requirements-inst) Installation tracking to record which packages are currently installed on which VINs / components
   * [DEPS](#requirements-deps) Package dependency tracking to create a per-vehicle update with necessary packages.
   * [SCHED](#requirements-sched) Installation scheduling, allows for priorities of updates and install period windows. 
   * [SHAPE](#requirements-shape) Traffic shaping allowing the integration of data plans and billing cycles to avoid data overrun costs
   * ~~[SCALE](#requirements-scale) Adds capacity for production deployment~~
