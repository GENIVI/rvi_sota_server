       * SOTA Server 

   - Preconditions

       * [TRANSFER_START](#TRANSFER_START) has been executed.
       * Device is connected to SOTA Server

   - Steps

       * E1 - SOTA Server retrieves the lowest numbered chunk (data block) that has yet to be transferred to Device
       * E2 - SOTA Server transmits chunk to Device
       * E3 - Device receives chunk

       * A2 - Chunk has already been received. Triggered by E4. (Retransmit of chunks are allowed in case the ack in E5 is lost).

           - A2.1 - New chunk is dropped
           - A2.2 - Use case continues at E5

       * X2 - Network connection lost before acknowledgement is received by SOTA Server. Triggered by E5. [DEV_CONNECT](#DEV_CONNECT) is executed X times in order to reconnect to the server. Chunk will be retransmitted, and E4.A1 will handle the case. After X time, we rely on [QUEUE_INITIATE_XMIT](#QUEUE_INITIATE_XMIT) for future retries.
