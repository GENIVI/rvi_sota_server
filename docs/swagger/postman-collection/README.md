## Development setup
TODO: run through a quick setup. refer to sota docs for sota_server. refer to postman docs for postman/import tests. 
Developers may want to run the tests using the commandline - In this case [*NEWMAN*](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman) is your friend.
The easiest way to install Newman is using NPM. If you have NodeJS installed, it is most likely that you have NPM installed as well.
```
$ npm install newman --global;
```
